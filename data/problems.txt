# Use # for uncomment lines
# Programm is able to read arguments of form:
# [a1, a2, ..., an] ⊢ c, wherby
# ai are the assumptions for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and c is the conclusion

p→q,p ⊢ q 													# Problem 1
(¬q),((¬q)→((¬p)→q)) ⊢ ((¬p)→q)								# Problem 2
¬(q),p→q ⊢ ¬(p)												# Problem 5
p ⊢ ((¬(q→r)→ ¬(p)) → (¬(r)→ ¬(q)))							# Excercise 1n
